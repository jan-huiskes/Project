# Project Amerikaanse verkiezingen

### Goals:

* what problem will be solved for the user

* what features will be available to solve the problem

* a visual sketch of what the application will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out; not in full detail though

* what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into the right form for your app

* what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together

* what external components (APIs) you probably need to make certain features possible

* technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these

* a review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)

### Proposal:
